# Speech Emotion Recognition System

## Overview
Developed a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using machine learning to classify human emotions from audio signals. The model analyzes speech features and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

## Key Features
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- MFCC, pitch, and energy-based emotion detection
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Multi-class emotion classification

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
- Download link: https://zenodo.org/record/1188976

## Results
- Trained model to classify multiple emotions from speech data
- Evaluated using accuracy and performance metrics

## How to Run
1. Open `EDP_CODE.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install required libraries.
3. Run all cells to train and test the model.
